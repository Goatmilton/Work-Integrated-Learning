## Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app_users` | User profiles and roles |
| `branches` | The three branch details |
| `products` | Product catalogue |
| `quote_requests` | Customer quote requests |
| `services`, `faqs`, `testimonials`, `homepage_assets` | Website and mobile app content |

<br>

## Relationships and Constraints

- Every table has it's own primary key.
- `app_users.id` links to `auth.users(id)` and deleting a login also deletes the profile.
- `testimonials.rating` must be between 1 and 5.
- Other like a quote's branch and product are stored as plain text and not enforced.

## Authentication

- Supabase Auth with the email provider turned on
- Email confirmation is on, and anonymous sign-ins are off
- Roles - Admin, branch managers and Customer are stored in `app_users.role`
- The functions `is_admin`, `is_staff` and `get_user_branch` support role checks

## Row Level Security

- RLS is on for seven tables, with no policies yet. The public Data API returns no data for them.
- Only the Node API can read and write, because it uses the secret key.
- RLS is off on `app_users`.

<br>

## Storage

- One public bucket: `woodlands-assets` (unchanged values: 50 MB default limit, any file type)
- Two policies: "Public Access" (can only view) and "Admin Uploads" (allows for uploads)

## Environment and Connection
> Both mobile and webapp do not touch the database or supabase but talk to the Node API which then relays what the webapp and mobile app require like completing requests, role specific actions and data control. 

- The Node API connects over HTTP / HTTPS using the Supabase client and runs on port 5000.
- The URL and secret keys are kept within the API's `.env` file, which is included in the `.Gitignore` file so it is excluded in the GitHub commits.
- The webapp only talks to the Node API.
- The mobile app only talks to the Node API. It keeps a local SQLite copy for offline use.
- A direct Postgres connection also exists (using port 5432, database `postgres`).
